=======================================




To reset a root password that you forgot (using paths on our system): 

[root@host root]#killall mysqld
[root@host root]#/usr/libexec/mysqld -Sg --user=root &

FreeBSD

/usr/local/libexec/mysqld  -Sg --user=root &


You may have better luck with: 

mysqld --skip-grant-tables --user=root

 

Go back into MySQL with the client: 

[root@host root]# mysql

Start MySQL the normal way for your system, and all is good. For Red Hat this is: 

/etc/init.d/mysqld start

 
Method 2
========

This tutorial is written in two ways. One way is for the compiled MySQL and one for the installed MySQL by RPM [tested only in Fedora]. It's not big deal, but I hope it is accessible also to newbies because the directory's change in both examples.

--------------------
If you compiled MySQL by yourself, go this way:

Maybe you have to change the directory where you installed MySQL (here it's /usr/local/mysql/ ).

1. Gain root access to your Linux system

code:[boby@space boby]$ su -
Password:
[root@space root]#


2. First you have to stop the daemon

code:[root@space root]# /etc/init.d/mysql.server stop
[root@space root]#


3. You will now start MySQL in safe mode without reading the grant tables with all MySQL database passwords and also you will disable networking. The "safe_mysqld" command will do this trick for you.

code:[root@space root]# /usr/local/mysql/bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql --skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
[root@space root]#


4. The "mysqladmin" command can now reset the root password. In this case we are setting it to "newpassword".

code:[root@space root]# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqladmin -u root flush-privileges password "newpassword"
[root@space root]#


5. And finally restart the daemon

code:[root@space root]# /etc/init.d/mysql.server restart
[root@space root]#


6. You can use now your new root password

code:[root@space root]# /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p
Enter password:

--------------------
If you installed MySQL by RPM or use the package that comes with the distribution, go this way:

1. Gain root access to your Linux system

code:[boby@space boby]$ su -
Password:
[root@space root]#


2. First you have to stop the daemon

code:[root@space root]# /etc/init.d/mysqld stop
[root@space root]#


3. You will now start MySQL in safe mode without reading the grant tables with all MySQL database passwords and also you will disable networking. The "safe_mysqld" command will do this trick for you.

code:[root@space root]# /usr/bin/safe_mysqld --user=mysql --socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid --datadir=/var/lib/mysql
--skip-grant-tables --skip-networking &
[root@space root]#


4. The "mysqladmin" command will now reset[rewrite] the root password. In this case we are setting it to "newpassword".

code:[root@space root]# mysqladmin -u root flush-privileges password "newpassword"
[root@space root]#


5. Stop the running daemon

code:kill `cat /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid`


6. And finally restart it

code:[root@space root]# /etc/init.d/mysqld start
[root@space root]#


7. You can use now your new root password

code:[root@space root]# mysql -u root -p
Enter password:
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 2 to server version: 4.0.20-standard

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

Changing MySQL root password
Sometimes you forget the root password, or something went wrong modifying it. Here's how to reset the root password for MySQL on a Redhat Linux box:

[root@host root]#killall mysqld 
[root@host root]#mysqld -Sg --user=root & 
[root@host root]# mysql
Welcome to the MySQL monitor. Commands end with ; or g. 
Your MySQL connection id is 1 to server version: 3.xx.xx 

Type 'help;' or 'h' for help. Type 'c' to clear the buffer.

You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

mysql> UPDATE user 
-> SET password=password("newpassword") 
-> WHERE user="root";

mysql> flush privileges; 

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec) 

mysql> exit; 
[root@host root]#killall mysqld 

Then start MySQL again: 

/etc/init.d/mysqld start




======================================


Don't sweat, fixing this is actually fairly easy. The documentation for MySQL notes that you can skip the MySQL authentication system on loadtime using the '--skip-grant-tables' load command. With MySQL loaded with no security, you can use either a MySQL admin gui or the MySQL commandline to reset your root password. 

You can find the MySQLadmin tool from http://dev.MySQL.com/downloads/administrator/1.0.html, or you can use the Novell-included phpMyAdmin on your own server. (Easier for those who don't understand the MySQL commandline.)

The full command to load MySQL like this is:

mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables --autoclose

(Editor's Note: Our technical reviewer found that he had to launch the mysqld_safe command without the '--autoclose' flag, otherwise the daemon never started.)

Once you have reset your password using your chosen MySQL admin tool, don't forget to immediately unload mysqld and reload it normally, as loading with that command leaves it wide open as root to any connections and is therefore a major security risk. 

Hope this helps others.
