In conjunction with the user change in the previous section, you should also change the permissions on the database files.  I used the opportunity to move the database files to another location.  By default, the database files are located in /var/db/mysql.  This can be changed by modifying the script /usr/local/bin/safe_mysqld.   But I prefer to leave scripts unchanged and just move the files.  So I did this:


/usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql-server.sh stop

cd /var/db
mv mysql /home/
ln -s /home/mysql mysql

Then I changed the permissions.

cd /home
chown -R mysql mysql

And then restarted mysqld.

/usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql-server.sh start


======================================



If you want to move the mysql directories to another partion, you can safely do the following:

1) Stop chkservd and mysql 

2) mv /var/lib/mysql wherever you want to put it. 

3) open my.cnf and check if the datadir is defined. If it is, it should say something like:

datadir = /var/lib/mysql

Change that to:

datadir = /path/to/new/location

If there isn't anything there for this variable in your my.cnf, simply add it below where it says [mysqld]

Then restart your chkservd and mysql and you are back in business with mysql databases on another partition. 

Cpanel won't overwrite this or know about it at all, since it's not really a matter of concern to how Cpanel operates.

=======================
When I restart mysql

it shows can not find mysql.sock
or can not find nameserver.pid

my my.cnf look like this at the top of the file

[mysqld]
datadir=/home/mysql
socket=/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

=======================

change it to:

socket=/home/mysql/mysql.sock




You can also create a symlink at /var/lib that points to /home/mysql, so anything looking for mysql at /var/lib/ will know where to find it.

do:

ln -s /home/mysql /var/lib/mysql

===========================================

/usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql-server.sh stop

cd /var/db

my mysql mysql_old

ln -s /home/mysql

cd /home
chown -R mysql:mysql mysql

/usr/local/etc/rc.d/mysql-server.sh start
