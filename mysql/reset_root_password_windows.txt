This section lists some of the steps you should take when upgrading MySQL on Windows. 

You should always back up your current MySQL installation before performing an upgrade. See Section 5.8.1, “Database Backups”. 

Download the latest Windows distribution of MySQL from http://dev.mysql.com. 

Before upgrading MySQL, you must stop the server. 

If the server is installed as a service, stop the service with the following command from the command prompt: 

C:\> NET STOP MySQL

If you are not running the MySQL server as a service, use the following command to stop the server: 

C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root shutdown

When upgrading to MySQL 4.1.5 or higher from a previous version, or when upgrading from a version of MySQL installed from a Zip archive to a version of MySQL installed with the MySQL Installation Wizard, you must manually remove the previous installation and MySQL service (if the server is installed as a service). 

To remove the MySQL service, use the following command: 

C:\> C:\mysql\bin\mysqld --remove

If you do not remove the existing service, the MySQL Installation Wizard may fail to properly install the new MySQL service. 

If you are using the MySQL Installation Wizard, start the wizard as described in Section 2.3.4, “Using the MySQL Installation Wizard”. 

If you are installing MySQL from a Zip archive, extract the archive. You may either overwrite your existing MySQL installation (usually located at C:\mysql), or install it into a different directory, such as C:\mysql4. Overwriting the existing installation is recommended. 

Restart the server. For example, use NET START MySQL if you run MySQL as a service, or invoke mysqld directly otherwise. 

Refer to Section 2.10, “Upgrading MySQL” for additional information on upgrading MySQL that is not specific to Windows.
