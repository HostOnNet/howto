By Default MySQL have no root password. To set a password for root, login to mysql


SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('WbKTt248');
SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'%' = PASSWORD('WbKTt248');


Now you will not able to login with out user name and password

# mysql
ERROR 1045: Access denied for user: 'root@localhost' (Using password: NO)

mysql -uroot -pWbKTt248


# mysql -uroot -pdddysql323
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 123 to server version: 4.0.16-log

Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the buffer.

mysql> exit
Bye
#


Now we set /root/.my.cnf this will allow user root to login with password and user specified in that file.



==============================================================================
vi /root/.my.cnf
[mysql]
user=root
password=dddysql323
==============================================================================

Now just mysql will work


# mysql

mysql -u root -p



SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('123456');

--------------------------------------------------------------
use mysql;
delete from user where User='';

--------------------------------------------------------------

mysql --user=root
(type enter for empty password)

then change the password for root :
update mysql.user set Password=PASSWORD('your_new_root_password') where User='root' and Hostname='localhost';
flush privileges;
quit;

This bit is what I originally wrote regarding the sysadmin password:

You should set the sysadmin password.  I did it like this:

mysqladmin -u root password newpassword

Personally, I don't like the way you have to specify the password on the command line.   Perhaps there is another way to change the password, but not that I could see.

You have just set the password for the mySQL root user, the sysadmin.   This is not the same as the UNIX root user.

Anthony Rubin wrote in with better information than I originally supplied.  I thank him for that.

Just wanted to give you some more information on the root password issue for mysql.   You most certainly do not have to put the password on the command line to change it and you really shouldn't.  Here is what you should do instead.  First type the following: 

mysql -u root -p

It will now prompt you for the current password.  After you enter the current password, you will enter the mysql client where you should use something like the following query to change your password: 

SET PASSWORD FOR root = PASSWORD('secret'); 

In this case root's password is changed to the word "secret".  There is only one problem with this.  It will only change root's password for connections from wherever you are currently connected from, probably localhost.  mysql usually has another entry for root for myhost.www.example.org.  To change this you can use the following query: 

SET PASSWORD FOR root@"myhost.www.example.org" 
                                    = PASSWORD('secret'); 

Of course you could also use a different password if you would like, although I'm not sure what purpose this would serve.  If you want to try out this second password you can connect in the following way: 

mysql -h myhost.www.example.org -u root -p

If you want to check for all root entries you can do the following: 

mysql -u root -p mysql

Then enter the following query: 

SELECT Host, User, Password FROM user WHERE User = 'root';

I'm pretty sure this should take care of everything.
