Setup Exim4 to use Spam Blacklists 

Below is a perfect method to setup exim to use several common spam blacklists such as spamhaus. Why can this be beneficial to you as a system admin? It can cut down incoming spam on your server by a great deal. This has saved me a lot of troubles and am bringing it here to help others.

----------------------
Creating lsearch files
----------------------
Create three text files in the /etc directory:

/etc/rblblacklist
/etc/rblbypass
/etc/rblwhitelist

# touch /etc/rblblacklist; touch /etc/rblbypass; touch /etc/rblwhitelist


SAMPLE DATA
/etc/rblblacklist is a manual blacklist, it rejects specific spammer hosts BEFORE they can send more email to your server:
domain1.com
domain2.com
domain3.com 

/etc/rblbypass bypasses RBL email testing for specific destination (local) domains that don't want RBL filtering or prefer SpamAssassin tagging:
domain1.com
domain2.com
domain3.com 

/etc/rblwhitelist blocks RBL email testing for listed incoming hosts, (wildcards allowed), in case an important client's mailserver is listed on an RBL you use, also automatically excludes relayhosts:
mail.domain1.com
*.domain2.com
*.domain3.com 


-------------------------------
EXIM CONFIGURATION EDITOR
-------------------------------

If you use the WHM-based Exim Configuration Editor, all of your modifications will be reproduced after each update. If you edit exim.conf directly, cPanel updates MAY overwrite your changes! Because of this, the following changes should be entered using the Exim Configuration Editor.

------------------------
Setting up lsearch files
------------------------


At the top of the editor, in the window below:
#!!# cPanel Exim 4 Config

Enter these lines: 

domainlist rbl_blacklist = lsearch;/etc/rblblacklist
domainlist rbl_bypass = lsearch;/etc/rblbypass
hostlist rbl_whitelist = lsearch;/etc/relayhosts : partial-lsearch;/etc/rblwhitelist

====
NOTE
====

change line

hostlist rbl_whitelist = lsearch;/etc/relayhosts : partial-lsearch;/etc/rblwhitelist

to

hostlist rbl_whitelist = lsearch;/etc/relayhosts : net-iplsearch;/etc/rblwhitelist

So that you can blacklist or white list per IP



----------------------------
RBL entries in ACL Section
----------------------------


RBL selection depends on many factors, be sure to edit the list below to reflect your priorities... Postmaster and abuse bypass allows blocked users to contact admin.

In the center window of the ACL section, directly below the line:

accept hosts = :

Enter these lines: 
#**#
#**# RBL List Begin
#**#
#
# Always accept mail to postmaster & abuse for any local domain
#
accept domains = +local_domains
local_parts = postmaster:abuse
#
# Check sending hosts against DNS black lists.
# Reject message if address listed in blacklist.
deny message = Message rejected because $sender_fullhost \
is blacklisted at $dnslist_domain see $dnslist_text
dnslists = dnsbl.njabl.org : \
bl.spamcop.net : \
sbl.spamhaus.org
# RBL Bypass Local Domain List
!domains = +rbl_bypass
# RBL Whitelist incoming hosts
!hosts = +rbl_whitelist
# Don't scan outgoing
!hosts = +relay_hosts
#**#
#**# RBL List End
#**# 



--------------------------------
RBL entries in ROUTERS Section
**************************

In the ROUTERS section window, directly below the line:
# in the "local_domains" setting above.

Enter these lines:

# Deny and send notice to list of rejected domains.
reject_domains:
driver = redirect
# RBL Blacklist incoming hosts
domains = +rbl_blacklist
allow_fail
data = :fail: Connection rejected: SPAM source $domain is manually blacklisted.


-----------------------------
RBL Testing and Verification
***********************

Once your file changes are in place, be sure to keep an eye out for errors... missing files and other errors will be listed here:
tail -50 /var/log/exim_paniclog 

You can view your spam filtering by reviewing the reject log:
tail -50 /var/log/exim_rejectlog 

If your RBL tests include sbl.spamhaus.org, you can test the blacklist and whitelist functions by sending an email, USING THE MAILSERVER YOU WISH TESTED, to:
nelson-sbl-test@crynwr.com 

It will attempt to send an email from mailserver sbl.crynwr.com, which is blacklisted in sbl.spamhaus.org

If the blacklist works, you'll get an email that looks something like this:

Subj: Your SBL test report
Testing your SBL block. See http://www.crynwr.com/spam/ for more info.
Please note that this test will not tell you if your server is open for
relaying. Instead, it tests to see if your server blocks email from IP
addresses listed in various blocking lists; in this case, the SBL list.

Here's how the conversation looked from sbl.crynwr.com.
Note that some sites don't apply the SBL block to postmaster, so
I use your envelope sender as the To: address.

I connected to 64.246.24.14 and here's the conversation I had:

220-whm.yourserver.com ESMTP Exim 4.24 #1 Thu, 16 Oct 2003 08:23:23 -0700 
220-We do not authorize the use of this system to transport unsolicited, 
220 and/or bulk e-mail.
helo sbl.crynwr.com
250 whm.yourserver.com Hello sbl.crynwr.com [192.203.178.107]

Terminating conversation

If the RBL block fails, you'll receive TWO emails:

Subj: Your SBL test report
Testing your SBL block. See http://www.crynwr.com/spam/ for more info.
Please note that this test will not tell you if your server is open for
relaying. Instead, it tests to see if your server blocks email from IP
addresses listed in various blocking lists; in this case, the SBL list.
