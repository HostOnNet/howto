cd /etc/xinetd.d

cp smtp_psa smtp_additional

(this makes a copy of smtp_psa called smtp_additional)

vi smtp_additional

(so we edit it now)

make the first line say "service submission"

Type :wq! to save your file.


Explanation 'submission' is an alias for port 587.

To make the changes take effect you must restart xinetd


/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd restart

That will make qmail (rather, xinetd) respond to smtp requests on port 587 as well as 25.

Cheers
